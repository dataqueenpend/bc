## 4. Best Practice Examples

Based on our analysis of top-performing interactions:

### Handling Price Objections
"I understand cost is a concern - that's exactly what [customer similar to you] said. After implementing our solution, they saved $X monthly. Let me show you how that breaks down for your situation..."

### Managing Time Constraints
"I respect your time. This conversation could save you significant money - would you prefer I email you the details now and call back at a better time, or can I share the key benefits in 2 minutes?"

### Addressing Need Objections
"Many customers felt they didn't need additional coverage until they saw what gaps they had. What would happen if [specific scenario] occurred with your current setup?"
